    - Create and prompts a confirmation modal for users to review their selections before final submission, enhancing user confidence in their choices.
2. **Update Route**:
    - Update the database with the incremented vote count for each selected candidate. to record the votes cast by voter during the voting process
    - Update the vote status for the current user to "Voted", to prevents multiple votes from the same user.
